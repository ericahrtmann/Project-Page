    <p>What truly makes us happy and what are ways<br> that we can live happier, healthier lives every day?</p>

    <h1>About Come On Get Happy</h1>
    <p>Come on Get Happy is a project that explores the happiness in our every day lives. The goal of the project is to inspire people to live their happiest lives every single day, in hopes that our increased happiness could positively affect the world. The idea is that if the average person is happier and healthier, our world will be happier and healthier too.
<br>
<br>
The 2018 World Happiness Report ranks 156 countries on their Happiness Index and the United States falls flat at number 18. I hope that by reminding people to focus on what truly makes them happy day-to-day we can increase the United State’s Happiness Index.
<br>
<br>
Come On Get Happy consists of a website that houses motion graphic videos, info-graphics and articles about living our happiest lives. The Come On Get Happy Instagram account provides daily reminders and motivational messages.
<br>
<br>
Throughout my project, I wanted to be cautious not to discount those who have disorders that truly affect their moods. I want to be mindful of people that experience depression, anxiety, bi-polar disorders, etc. that may not be able to increase happiness by simply being reminded to. I wanted to be careful not to assume that every person has the ability to simply “think good thoughts” to create a better life.</p>

    <h1>Process</h1>
    <p>The process for my project was made up of these main steps:<br><br><b>Survey users, narrow content, develop branding and create elements</b></p>

    <h3>SURVEY USERS</h3>
    <p>To ensure that Come On Get Happy is beneficial to the largest number of people, I conduted a survey using Google Forms and received about 225 responses. The survey asked users about their "happiness habits" and what makes them happiest in their every day lives.<br><br>You can see the full results from my survey <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18OJw_u8oPvaMpshGTr6KrKvI3iS6I2JILOPbpNp2re0/edit#responses">here.</a></p>

    <h3>NARROW CONTENT</h3>
    <p>I received a lot of amazing information from the survey results, and decided to narrow my focus for Come On Get Happy to three main topics:<br><br>Personal Relationships<br>Healthy Habits<br>and Self Care<br><br>It was important that I narrow the focus of my project, because personal happiness can mean many different things for every person, but the survey results suggested that these three themes would resonate with the highest number of people.  </p>

    <h3>DEVELOP BRANDING</h3>
    <p>Creating a solid branding was really important for the overall Come On Get Happy project. I wanted to develop a brand that could be eaily adapted across a wide range of products and elements and at the same time, make the audience feel happy!</p>

    <h3>CREATE ELEMENTS</h3>
    <p>The elements that I created for Come On Get Happy are:<br><br>A website<br>Motion Graphic Video<br>Infographics<br>PDF Worksheets</p>
